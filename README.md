uPaste
======

See http://pastebin.com/ or any other online pasting tool. This one is special because you can easily download and run you own local version of it from your computer. This is especially good for paranoid people.

build
=====

For now, simple check out from this repository and run mvn assembly:assembly to build. The .jar will be in the target/ directory.
